 Thank you for the feedback I have received so far!

 Since I think many of you might be interested, I have written
 a summary of questions, suggestions, wishes and bug
 reports (marked with a "Q:"), and my answer/comment (marked
 with a "A:").
 I would like to get feedback on things you find important that
 I should change. And if you think about any additional features,
 please add these also.
 I try to implement PMVDesk Common User Access (CUA) conformant;
 so I would like to get your comments if somthing does not feel
 right.
 

Q:
 the "Move Desktop" menu choice should probably also be on the main
 menu (the one accessed by MB2 click on black area)

A:
 I do not think that is necessary.


Q:
 Cannot switch between applications using Ctrl-Esc.  The Alt-Esc
 round-robin only works between applications on the active desktop

A:
 How do you want it to be? Should the desktop follow the active
 window, or vice versa?


Q:
 I am getting "phantom" windows on the desktop that do not go away;
 are caused by pulldown menus, and possibly dialog boxes; e.g.,
 pulldown menu of bitmaps on the Background page of the Desktop
 Settings notebook.

A:
 I would like to get more specifik information about this.
 I might have a bug, since I am experimenting with a new "window
 enumeration engine" in this beta. If I can not fix the bug, I
 just use my older "window enumeration engine" that is stable
 (but slower).


Q:
 What do the grid options do?  I haven't been able to see if
 they do anything at all.
Q:
 Sometimes you can drag the objects around with MB1, sometimes not.
 (I can't tell what causes it to stop working)

A:
 These questions are related. If you use a grid option, you must
 move the window (mouse pointer) the amount of the grid.
 The reason i implemented the grid option is that you might want
 to move your screen for example exactly one screen.
 I will add the possibility to click in the black area to move
 the screen in that direction.
 I might include a option to show the grid in the PMVDesk window.


Q:
 Question: Why is Retrieve on Exit an option?  Would you ever not
 want to do this?

A:
 I do not want to retrieve all windows back if I have to
 temporaryly close PMVDesk. (for example when I compile a
 new version)


Q:
 There should be a way to tell more clearly what the things are.
 That is, someway to cause it to display the text (title) as part
 of the diagram.

A:
 Yes, I think I have to implement a option to show the window
 title in the mini window. Currently you see the title in
 the local pop-up menu.


Q:
 VIO windows do not always redraw correctly after being dragged
 to another place in the virtual space (a thin area of the
 desktop shows through along the right side of the window).
Q:
 Occasionally lose keyboard control in VIO windows after making
 them active.
Q:
 I don't know if it's a real bug or if it has something to do
 with PMVD but suddenly I saw that sometimes my DOS-Box was not
 redrawn correctly after I started PMVD.
 Some thin lines disturbed the picture or one horizontal row was
 shifted one char towards the left border. So wait for tests of
 other people if they have these problems suddenly, too. And then
 decide if it's a bug of PMVD.

A:
 I have had no such problems on my system, so if you experience
 anything like this I would like to hear about it.


Q:
 When the tiny-WPS-window covers the tiny-VA-window (VA = visible
 area) you can't move the tiny-VA-window directly with the mouse.
 You can only do so when click on one tiny-window with the right
 mouse button and select the menu-item 'Move Desktop' 

A:
 Your Workplace Shell ("Desktop") window is called somthing else
 than "Desktop". This is a "bug" of PMVDesk, or to be more specific,
 I have not yet implemented a installation routine that checks (and
 ask if nessesary) the name of your desktop window.
 I also intend to add the possibility to click in the black area
 so you can quickly move in that direction.


Q:
 You have not integrated a Quit-command in the local menu of PMVD
 (when you click on the black area), so that you have to toggle ON
 the title bar to Quit PMVD.

A:
 Well I have not implemented a "Quit" menu option, but if you look
 in the "Window" submenu, you will find the "Close" option. Use
 this or the Alt+F4 key kombination. I will add a "Quit" menu
 option if and only if I get many requests for a "Quit" menuitem.


Q:
 When you have opened many windows and there is not much black
 background left in the PMVD-window it is hard to open the local
 menu. You may add the possibility to open the local menu with the
 left button (all over the PMVD-window), too.

A:
 You may size the main PMVDesk window to get more black area.
 But I will consider to add a possibility to activate the main
 menu (all over the PMVD-window). If you think this is needed,
 please suggest different activation methods.


Q:
 When I have opened many windows and made the size of the PMVD-
 window very small some tiny-windows are not visible. In this
 case that some tiny windows are not visible and that you can
 not access them directly with the mouse, scrollbars would make
 a sense.

A:
 Sorry, I do not like the idea of scrollbars. But again, if many
 of you insist...
 Try keeping the "Scale" big enough, so that you kan access all
 windows.


Q:
 You can move the PMVD-window only when you click on the black
 area with the left button. I think it would be better to allow
 it also or only with the right button, because normally you make
 movements with the right button (under OS/2), at least I was
 habbitted so.

A:
 If I understand CUA correctly, you move windows with mouse
 button 1 (usually left button), and objects with mouse button 2
 (usually right button). (Correct me if I am wrong)
 This is a question of preferences, so maybe I must implement a
 option, so the user can choose what ever feel better.


Q:
 It would be nice to be able to toggle the title bar on/off with
 a double click (left and right button) on the PMVD-window.

A:
 If you insist, I will add this feature. The only problem might
 be that I might assign some other more important features to
 these mouse double clicks.


Q:
 Sometimes I want the PMVD-window totally out of the way without
 closing it, but I  can't because it has a minimum size AND you
 can't LET IT HANG OVER the border of the VA (Of course it must
 not be allowd to put it totally out of the visible area, but
 let it hang over!).

A:
 Try using the "Hide" option from the main menus "Window"
 submenu (or press Alt+F11).
 Should I let it "hang over"?


Q:
 Sometimes I clicked on the wrong tiny window and moved it,
 but I didn't want it. So it would be also nice that you can
 press ESC while moving the tiny window in PMVD with the
 left (perhaps soon right) button, so that the window keeps
 on the place where it was before starting moving it, like
 it is also possible under OS/2.

A:
 This is a bug, and I will fix it. I will also enable the
 tracking with arrow-keys.


Q:
 Highlight the tiny-window which is on top/really highlighted
 (I mean that one that represents the window that is really
 higlighted)

A:
 I think you mean the active window. Yes, this is a good idea.


Q:
 For the grids to be more useful, there should probably be
 smaller options, like 5, 10, or 20 pixels, in addition to
 large fractions of screen size.
Q:
 Allow a scale of 1:2

A:
 I have the intention to implement a slider or spinbutton, so
 the user can freely adjust the scale or grids.


Q:
 In the local menus of the tiny windows there's the command
 'Move Desktop' but it seams to me that the command better
 should be called 'Move Visible Area' otherwise confusion
 might come up because somebody may understand that the
 movement of the WPS-window is meant!

A:
 I think I will call it "Move screen".


Q:
 I saw the feature of OS/2 with ctrl-move the first time but
 the pmvd-window itself does not work with it: when you press
 ctrl and try to move PMVD-window it becomes highlighted and
 comes to the top!

A:
 You are right. I think I have to change this!


Q:
 When I have a "Screen grid" (1:1), and move between different
 screens, PMVDesk moves the screen allmost correctly, but not
 quite.

A:
 Yes, this is a bug, since I have not "calibrated" the tracking
 yet.


Q:
 What does "Cancel" on the menus do?  If it just cancels
 the menu, that's not necessary.  I thought it might exit the
 program; it might be good to have this as an explicit option
 on one of the popup menus, instead of under "Window->Close".

A:
 "Cancel" does nothing but cancels the menu. I added this so
 you would not click on menu choises by accident. I might
 remove "Cancel" if you feel it is unnecessary.


Q:
 Right-clicking on the grey "Screen" area brings up a menu
 that says "Screen" (which you can't select) and "Cancel",
 which does nothing. Don't bother with the menu unless something
 is worth selecting.

A:
 "Screen" is the title of the window, as in other window
 specific menus. You are right, this menu is maybe
 unnecessary.


Q:
 On a related note, grey out the "title" which is the first
 choice on each popup menu to make it clear that it can't be
 selected.

A:
 If you like it better that way, why not.


Q:
 Under the "Scale", "Screen Grid", and "Window Grid" options,
 use check marks instead of greying to indicate the current
 option.

A:
 I will! I hate these disabled menu choises also. :-)


Q:
 When dragging a window by its title bar, dragging off the
 edge of the screen should result in the grey "screen area"
 following the window.  In fact, this should happen any time
 the mouse moves off the edge of the visible desktop.

A:
 Yes, I have considered this.


Q:
 Somehow I was able to produce a 'drag' effect: what I mean
 is that when I did some rearranging of windows on the desktop,
 the display on the PMVD window didn't update immediately. I
 can't reproduce this right now.

A:
 Yes, you are right. I have seen the same happen on my system, and
 it seems to be quite random. I thought it had to do with some
 dialogboxes (eg. you open a dialogbox, close it, and the move the
 main window, or switch desktop), but I can not reproduce it always.
 If you find out any "pattern" how it always can be reproduced, I
 would be very happy to hear about it.


Q:
 One suggestion I will make which I think would be a worthwhile
 addition; when double clicking with the mouse on a window on
 PMVD's 'desktop', PMVD should switch focus to that window and
 if the window is not visible on the screen, it should move the
 viewport to make it visible.  This would be very nice in that
 it would allow application switching easily from a global point
 of view and be an alternative to moving the view then setting
 focus by clicking on the application window itself.

A:
 Yes, this is a very good idea!
 The other possibility could be to move the window you double
 click to the current viewport (screen).


Q:
 How do I register? What is your registration fee?

A:
 No panic... No hurry...
 It just happens that I have written a screen capture
 program (PMSnap) with my friend Peter Nielsen and I just
 copyed the "About" dialogbox from that program. (PMSnap
 is almost ready, just have to finish the online help).
 PMVDesk might be shareware or freeware.
 I have not decided anything yet. This is not question of
 the day yet. Not before PMVDesk is ready for release.
 And although the titlebar and "About" tells you to register,
 this is only a beta, and you are free to use it.
 Anyway, I am also using a unregistered version... :-)

Since my english is not perfect, I wish you do not mind
that I make a lot of spelling errors.
You might be able to help me with some naming problems
I have in PMVDesk. What should I call the visible area:
- desktop
- visible area
- viewport
- screen  (currently I prefer this, since the screen is
           the hardware that you always look at)

Should I call my tiny windows:
- tiny windows
- mini windows

What should I call the black space:
- virtual desktop
- space



Thanks again for your feedback and the time you put to
test PMVDesk and write comments to me. I will be back
with more information, and later with new versions.
