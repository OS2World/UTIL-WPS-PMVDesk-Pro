Hello!

Thank you for showing interest in PMVDesk!

Here comes the evaluation (beta) copy of the new PMVDesk.
As it is a beta without documentation, the support I can
give you is quite limited. It is very time consuming for
me to write in english, and so you must wait for the real
documentation to be finished.
However here are some hints and tips...
Before starting PMVDesk:
- make sure your desktop name is "Desktop", otherwise you
  might run in to problems. (You can do this by looking
  at the file hierarchy, and look for a folder called
  "Desktop").
- check that you do not have any previous PMVDESKB.INI
  files in the path.
- PMVDDLL.DLL must be in the LIBPATH (usually it is fine
  if it is in the same directory as PMVD.EXE)

After starting PMVDesk:
- the black area is the virtual space (if you click mouse
  button 2 you open the main popup-menu)
- the gray area represents the screen
- each white window represents your current applications
- all windows in PMVDesk have their own popup-menu, click
  mouse button 2 to activate menus.
- by sizing the PMVDesk main window you can alternate the
  size of the virtual world.
- "Save position and size" is not yet implemented.
- use mouse button 1 to move windows (press mouse button 1
  on a window, keep it down, and drag the window)
- if you do not want to make the window you move the top
  window, keep ctrl-key down to move windows in the
  background.
- from the main windows popup-menu you can alternate the
  scaling of windows (try it!)
- from the main windows popup-menu you can alternate the
  grid of the screen movement (try it!)
- from the main windows popup-menu you can alternate the
  grid of the windows movement (try it!)
- from each windows popup-menu you can check the "sticky"
  option to keep windows sticky while you move the screen.

Feel free to experiment different options in PMVDesk.

A short FAQ (PMVDesk frequently asked questions):

 What does PMVDesk do to my system and windows?
 -----------------------------------------------
 PMVDesk only moves/repositions your windows, nothing else!
 I have implemented PMVDesk so that it does not change anything
 in your system configuration. All PMVDesk does is:
 - installs a "input" and "sendmsg" -hook
 - moves/repositions your windows

 How did you implement PMVDesk?
 ------------------------------
 First I enumerate all your wisible windows, and query their
 size and position. I create a tiny window representing your
 window, divide the size of the original by the value selected
 in "Scale" an position this window in PMVDesk window. I store 
 the window handle, and the eqvivalent window handle of my tiny 
 window, so I can later find the corresponding windows.
 When you move the tiny window in PMVDesk, PMVDesk repositions
 your window to the new position. When you move your original
 window a "sendmsg" hook checks if your action should affect the
 the tiny window in PMVDesk. If you close or start an application, 
 the "sendmsg" hook checks if some action is needed in PMVDesk.

 IMPORTANT!
 As this is a evaluation (beta) copy of the new PMVDesk, I wish
 you do NOT distribute or copy this to anyone. The reason for this
 is just simply that I do not want to make PMVDesk publicly
 available before I have finished the documentation.
 Feel free to use it and show it to your friends and colleagues.
 If you like, you may also write about PMVDesk for example in the
 news groups.

 I would be more than glad to get any comments on PMVDesk.
